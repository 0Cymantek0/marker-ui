# Supported Output Formats

Marker UI supports converting documents into several structured formats. Choosing the correct format determines how text, tables, and images are exported.

---

## 1. Markdown (Default)
Generates standard GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
- **Text & Flow**: Restructures multi-column layouts into standard top-to-bottom reading blocks.
- **Equations**: Re-formats inline and display math equations into standard LaTeX (e.g. `\( E=mc^2 \)`).
- **Tables**: Parses rows and columns into clean Markdown grid syntax.

---

## 2. JSON
Returns a structured JSON payload representing the document structure.
- Ideal for downstream LLM ingestion, agentic workflows, or custom database ingestion.
- Contains separate fields for document metadata, raw text, and tables.

---

## 3. HTML
Generates structured HTML5 markup with semantic layout tags.
- Keeps tables as `<table>` tags and equations formatted clearly.

---

## 4. Chunks
Segments the document text into smaller, overlapping chunks.
- Optimized for creating vector embeddings in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

## Handling Extracted Images & Assets

When converting documents containing images, charts, or diagrams:
1. **Extraction**: The underlying engine extracts images and stores them as separate files on the server.
2. **Markdown Links**: The generated Markdown links these files using relative paths (e.g. `![Image 1](images/page_1_img_1.png)`).
3. **ZIP Downloads**: To prevent broken image links, downloading a job with extracted images will package the Markdown file and the `images/` folder together into a single `.zip` archive.
4. **Current Gaps**: Rich text descriptions or captions for charts, screenshots, and diagrams are not yet automatically generated.
