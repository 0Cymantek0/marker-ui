# Storage & Directory Architecture

Marker UI relies on a persistent storage directory on the host machine (or in a Docker volume) to cache neural model weights, persist SQLite records, encrypt settings, and store uploaded documents and converted results.

---

## Directory Structure

By default, the application maps all runtime storage under the `data/` directory:

```text
marker-ui/
└── data/
    ├── uploads/           # Temporary folder for received files
    ├── output/            # Converted files, organized by Job ID
    │   └── {job_id}/
    │       ├── output.md  # Converted Markdown file
    │       └── images/    # Extracted PNG/JPG images
    ├── marker_ui.db       # SQLite database file
    └── .secret_key        # Auto-generated 32-byte Fernet key
```

## Storage Components

### 1. Uploads Folder (`data/uploads/`)
- When a document is uploaded via `POST /api/convert/upload`, the raw file is written here first.
- Once the conversion job starts, the `TaskManager` references this file.
- The file is deleted automatically from `uploads/` after the job is processed (either successfully or failed).

### 2. Output Folder (`data/output/`)
- Converted results are saved into a folder named after the job UUID.
- If images are extracted, they are placed in `data/output/{job_id}/images/`.
- The contents of this folder are packaged into a ZIP file when a download is requested if the folder contains extracted image folders.
- Deleting a job from history purges this folder.

### 3. SQLite Database (`data/marker_ui.db`)
- Houses metadata for all jobs and system settings.
- Initialized and updated automatically via Alembic database migrations.

### 4. Fernet Key File (`data/.secret_key`)
- Auto-generated on the first system start.
- If you lose this file, you will be unable to decrypt any previously saved API keys in SQLite, and will need to re-enter them in the UI.
